## Make tests with Foundry

Be sure you've [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) installed on your computer. Foundry depends on Rust, so it's needed too.

After you've installed Foundry you'll be able to run `forge` commands. Follow these steps to run tests:

```
forge install
forge build
forge test
```
